Awesome Accessible Pentesting Tools



> A collection of awesome **accessible** penetration testing resources.

Penetration testing is the practice of launching authorized, simulated attacks against computer systems and their physical infrastructure to expose potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

To be able to add your project to this list, your tool must:
- [ ] Not use ascii art (or provide an option to turn it entirely off)
- [ ] Avoid extreme colours and instead opt for boldness to represent importance, or use matieral design accessible colour schemes.
- [ ] No extremely long paragraphs
- [ ] Be a terminal app, sorry, but this is far easier to test than a GUI for us :-(
